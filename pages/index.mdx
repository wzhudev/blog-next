# Wenzhao Hu

Hi! I am Wenzhao Hu, a software engineer residing in Shanghai. I am passionate about open-source, collaborative software and different kinds of editors. That's part of the reasons why I am working on _Univer_ team at _DreamNum_. 

Univer was born from a simple yet profound insight: the need for a seamless, integrated platform where work flows freely, without the constraints of disjointed contexts or the hassle of switching formats. The journey of Univer is just beginning, and I am excited to be part of it.

I am also a big fan of open-source software and have contributed to many projects on GitHub. For more information about my professional experience and projects, please check the following sections.
