I maintain minimalism in the tools I use, aiming to stay focused on the tasks at hand 
and avoid investing too much time and effort in tweaking tools. 

After trying out many things, I have streamlined down to the following:

## Hardware

- **Lenovo YOGA Slim 14s 2021** - My main work laptop. It has a 2.8k screen and is lightweight.
- **MacBook Pro M2 Max** - A gift from my wife.
- **AOC 4K Monitor** - It connects to my laptop with a USB-C cable, charing and screen display.
- **Xiaomi Wireless Dual-Mode Mouse 2** - A simple and reliable wireless mouse to keep my desk clean.
- **HHKB Professional Classic** - A gift from my wife. 
- **Xiaomi 14 Pro**

## Software

### General

- **Microsoft Edge**
- **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)** - Notes. 
- **[WeChat Input Method](https://z.weixin.qq.com)** - I use it on both laptop and phone. It has **Xiaohe Double Pinyin** built-in, and can sync clipboards between computers and phones.

### Windows

- **[AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)** - Used for window management and custom shortcuts.
- **[Pixpin](https://pixpinapp.com/)** - The best screenshot software on Windows.
- **[AutoDarkMode](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/XP8JK4HZBVF435?launch=true&mode=full&hl=en-us&gl=cn&ocid=bingwebsearch)** - Automatically switches to dark mode at night.

### macOS

- **Raycast** - Mainly used for window management.
- **Hammerspoon** - Does similar tasks to AutoHotKey.
