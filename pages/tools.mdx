I maintain minimalism in the tools I use, aiming to stay focused on the tasks at hand 
and avoid investing too much time and effort in tweaking tools. 

After trying out many things, I have streamlined down to the following:

## Devices

- **Lenovo YOGA Slim 14s 2021**
- **MacBook Pro M2 Max** - A gift from the squirrel.
- **HHKB Professional Classic** - A gift from the squirrel.
- **AOC 4K Monitor** - Basic model with Type-C cable.
- **Xiaomi Wireless Dual-Mode Mouse 2** 
- **Xiaomi Screen Hanging Lamp** - Increases desktop brightness while reading, relieves eye fatigue.
- **Xiaomi 14 Pro** - A gift from the squirrel.

## Daily use software

### General

- **Microsoft Edge**
- **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)** - Notes. 
- **[WeChat Input Method](https://z.weixin.qq.com)** - I use it on both laptop and phone. It has **Xiaohe Double Pinyin** built-in, and can sync clipboards between computers and phones.

### Windows

- **[AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)** - Used for window management and custom shortcuts.
- **[Pixpin](https://pixpinapp.com/)** - The best screenshot software on Windows.
- **[AutoDarkMode](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/XP8JK4HZBVF435?launch=true&mode=full&hl=en-us&gl=cn&ocid=bingwebsearch)** - Automatically switches to dark mode at night.

### macOS

- **Raycast** - Mainly used for window management.
- **Hammerspoon** - Does similar tasks to AutoHotKey.
