I maintain minimalism in the tools I use, aiming to stay focused on the tasks at hand 
and avoid investing too much time and effort in tweaking tools. 

After trying out many things, I have streamlined down to the following:

## Devices

- **MacBook Pro M2 Max**
- **Lenovo YOGA Slim 14s 2021**
- **HHKB Professional Classic**
- **AOC 4K Monitor** - Basic model with Type-C cable.
- **Xiaomi Wireless Dual-Mode Mouse 2** 
- **Xiaomi Screen Hanging Lamp** - Increases desktop brightness while reading, relieves eye fatigue.
- **Xiaomi 14 Pro**
- **Shokz Openfit**

## Daily use software

### General

- **[WeChat Input Method](https://z.weixin.qq.com)** - I use it on both laptop and phone. It has **Xiaohe Double Pinyin** built-in, and can sync clipboards between computers and phones.
- **[Notion](https:/notion.so)** - Notes, clippers, and task management all in one.
- **Google Chrome**

### Windows

- **[Pixpin](https://pixpinapp.com/)** - The best screenshot software on Windows.
- **[AutoHotKey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/)** - Enhances the shortcut key experience on Windows, such as switching between windows of the same application, activating specific applications, etc.
- **[AutoDarkMode](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/XP8JK4HZBVF435?launch=true&mode=full&hl=en-us&gl=cn&ocid=bingwebsearch)** - Automatically switches to dark mode at night.

### macOS

- **Raycast** - Mainly used for window management.
- **Hammerspoon** - Does similar tasks to AutoHotKey.

## Devtools

- **Visual Studio Code (vscode)** - I use [vscodevim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim). 

### Windows

- **Microsoft Terminal**
- **WSL2**

## dotfiles
